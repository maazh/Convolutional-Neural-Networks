This repository covers all the projects I shall be doing in the course. The focus would be to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. 

Thanks to deep learning, computer vision is working far better than just two years ago, and this is enabling numerous exciting applications ranging from safe autonomous driving, to accurate face recognition, to automatic reading of radiology images.
